methods: "A deterministic SIS age-discretized model with multiple immunity compartments."
methods_long: "The model includes terms for seasonal forcing, up to 3 prior exposures to RSV, infant and/or elder vaccination, birth rate, death rate, and ageing.  Parameters describing pathogen characteristics were primarily fit using pre-pandemic data.  Initial susceptible states are estimated by filtering candidate reduced-beta trajectories for the pandemic seasons (2020-21 and 2021-20), followed by normal-beta trajectories for 2022-23.  We also make an adjustment to the ascertainment rate based on the 2022-23 season.  The filtered candidate trajectories then use current season data to adjust timing, and are again filtered to the final posterior set.  Current season calibrations are made using Scenario C assumptions."
