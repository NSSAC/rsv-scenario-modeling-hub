methods: "The ensemble projection is obtained by calculating the weighted median of the median projection for each submission. The median projection is also calculated for each corresponding quantile for the ensemble uncertainty intervals. Ensemble projection includes only those submissions that reported quantiles for their targets. By default a weight of 1 is assigned for each submission, 0.5 if a team makes two submissions."
